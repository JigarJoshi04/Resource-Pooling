Databases => Postgresql, mysql, nosql (dynamo, mongodb)
ORM => GORM, bunSQL

Open questions =>
- How do we connect DB with ORM?
- One possible answer is that we create the DB object using config
- Can I create 10 Database objects?
- How to release the Database object once we are done using that cursor

POC required =>
- Creating multiple databases object and store it in some array
- Second stage would be to make this stroage array generic that can store anything
- Creating an algorithm that will help us to understand and get the database pointer that was recently freed as it would be a warm connection, if no warm connections are found we will try
to get the cold pointer.
